Zuul Dashboard Javascript
=========================

zuul-web has an html, css and javascript component, `zuul-dashboard`, that
is managed using Javascript toolchains. It is intended to be served by zuul-web
directly from zuul/web/static in the simple case, or to be published to
an alternate static web location, such as an Apache server.

The web dashboard is written in `React`_ and `PatternFly`_ and is
managed by `create-react-app`_ and `yarn`_ which in turn both assume a
functioning and recent `nodejs`_ installation.

.. note::

   The web dashboard source code and package.json are located in the ``web``
   directory. All the yarn commands need to be executed from the ``web``
   directory.

For the impatient who don't want deal with javascript toolchains
----------------------------------------------------------------

tl;dr - You have to build stuff with javascript tools.

The best thing would be to get familiar with the tools, there are a lot of
good features available. If you're going to hack on the Javascript, you should
get to know them.

If you don't want to hack on Javascript and just want to run Zuul's tests,
``tox`` has been set up to handle it for you.

If you do not have `yarn`_ installed, ``tox`` will use `nodeenv`_ to install
node into the active python virtualenv, and then will install `yarn`_ into
that virtualenv as well.

yarn dependency management
--------------------------

`yarn`_ manages the javascript dependencies. That means the first step is
getting `yarn`_ installed.

.. code-block:: console

  tools/install-js-tools.sh

The ``tools/install-js-tools.sh`` script will add apt or yum repositories and
install `nodejs`_ and `yarn`_ from them. For RPM-based distros it needs to know
which repo description file to download, so it calls out to
``tools/install-js-repos-rpm.sh``.

Once yarn is installed, getting dependencies installed is:

.. code-block:: console

  yarn install

The ``yarn.lock`` file contains all of the specific versions that were
installed before. Since this is an application it has been added to the repo.

To add new runtime dependencies:

.. code-block:: console

  yarn add awesome-package

To add new build-time dependencies:

.. code-block:: console

  yarn add -D awesome-package

To remove dependencies:

.. code-block:: console

  yarn remove terrible-package

Adding or removing packages will add the logical dependency to ``package.json``
and will record the version of the package and any of its dependencies that
were installed into ``yarn.lock`` so that other users can simply run
``yarn install`` and get the same environment.

To update a dependency:

.. code-block:: console

  yarn add awesome-package

Dependencies are installed into the ``node_modules`` directory. Deleting that
directory and re-running ``yarn install`` should always be safe.

Dealing with yarn.lock merge conflicts
--------------------------------------

Since ``yarn.lock`` is generated, it can create merge conflicts. Resolving
them at the ``yarn.lock`` level is too hard, but `yarn`_ itself is
deterministic. The best procedure for dealing with ``yarn.lock`` merge
conflicts is to first resolve the conflicts, if any, in ``package.json``. Then:

.. code-block:: console

  yarn install --force
  git add yarn.lock

Which causes yarn to discard the ``yarn.lock`` file, recalculate the
dependencies and write new content.

React Components and Styling
----------------------------

Each page is a React Component. For instance the status.html page code
is ``web/src/pages/status.jsx``. It is usually a good idea not to put
too much markup in those page components and create different
components for this instead. This way, the page component can deal
with the logic like reloading data if needed or evaluating URL
parameters and the child components can deal with the markup.  Thus,
you will find a lot of components in the ``web/src/containers``
directory that mainly deal with the markup.

Mapping of pages/urls to components can be found in the route list in
``web/src/routes.js``.

The best way to get started is to check out the libraries that glue
everything together. Those are `React`__, `react-router`_ and
`Redux`_.

__ React-getting-started_

For the visual part we are using `PatternFly`_. For a list of available
PatternFly React components, take a look at the `Components`_ section in their
documentation. If a single component is not enough, you could also take a
look at the `Demos`_ sections which provides some more advanced examples
incorporating multiple components and their interaction.

If you are unsure which component you should use for your purpose, you might
want to check out the `Usage and behaviour`_ section in their design guidelines.

There is also a list of available `icons`_ including some recommendations on
when to use which icon. In case you don't find an appropriate icon there, you
could check out the `FontAwesome Free`_ icons, as most of them are included in
PatternFly. To find out if an icon is available, simply try to import it from
the ``@patternfly/react-icons`` package.

For example if you want to use the `address-book`_ icon (which is not listed in
the PatternFly icon list) you can import it via the following statement:

.. code-block:: javascript

   import { AddressBookIcon } from '@patternfly/react-icons'

Please note that the spelling of the icon name changes to CamelCase and is
always extended by ``Icon``.

Development
-----------

Building the code can be done with:

.. code-block:: bash

  yarn build

zuul-web has a ``static`` route defined which serves files from
``zuul/web/static``. ``yarn build`` will put the build output files
into the ``zuul/web/static`` directory so that zuul-web can serve them.

Development server that handles things like reloading and
hot-updating of code can be started with:

.. code-block:: bash

  yarn start

will build the code and launch the dev server on `localhost:3000`. Fake
api response needs to be set in the ``web/public/api`` directory.

.. code-block:: bash

  mkdir public/api/
  for route in info status jobs builds; do
  curl -o public/api/${route} https://zuul.openstack.org/api/${route}
  done

To use an existing zuul api, uses the REACT_APP_ZUUL_API environment
variable:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Use openstack zuul's api:
  yarn start:openstack

  # Use software-factory multi-tenant zuul's api:
  yarn start:multi

  # Use a custom zuul:
  REACT_APP_ZUUL_API="https://zuul.example.com/api/" yarn start

To run eslint tests locally:

.. code-block:: bash

  yarn lint

Deploying
---------

The web application is a set of static files and is designed to be served
by zuul-web from its ``static`` route. In order to make sure this works
properly, the javascript build needs to be performed so that the javascript
files are in the ``zuul/web/static`` directory. Because the javascript
build outputs into the ``zuul/web/static`` directory, as long as
``yarn build`` has been done before ``pip install .`` or
``python setup.py sdist``, all the files will be where they need to be.
As long as `yarn`_ is installed, the installation of zuul will run
``yarn build`` appropriately.

By default, zuul-web provides a Progressive Web Application but does
not run a Service Worker. For deployers who would like to enable one,
set the environment variable
``REACT_APP_ENABLE_SERVICE_WORKER=true`` during installation.
