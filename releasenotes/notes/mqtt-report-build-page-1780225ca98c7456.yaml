    Although the documentation states that the MQTT reporter reports the build's
    log_url, this was only true as long as :attr:`tenant.report-build-page` was
    disabled. As soon as the setting was enabled, the MQTT reporter reported the
    url to the build's result page in Zuul. As MQTT is meant to be consumed by
    machines, this broke use cases like log post processing.

    This was fixed so that the :attr:`<mqtt schema>.buildset.builds.log_url` now
    always contains the log url, while an additional field
    :attr:`<mqtt schema>.buildset.builds.web_url` contains the url to the
    build's result page if :attr:`tenant.report-build-page` is enabled.
